4. **Main App Layout**: Set up App.tsx with proper component structure and dark theme

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
You are an expert full-stack engineer specializing in modern frontend development. Your task is to set up a complete, production-ready project foundation for a portfolio website.

**1. Technology Setup:**
- Initialize a new project using **Vite** with the **React** and **TypeScript** template.
- Install and fully configure **Tailwind CSS**.
- Install our animation libraries: `framer-motion` and `@react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three`.

**2. Folder Structure:**
- Inside the `src` directory, create the following feature-based folder structure. Create a placeholder `.tsx` file inside each component folder as specified.

[Include the folder structure from above]

**3. Dummy Data File:**
- In `src/lib/data.ts`, create and export constants containing all the dummy content provided above (Name, Bio, Skills, Projects, Links, etc.).

**4. Main App Layout:**
- In `App.tsx`, import the main feature components (`Header`, `Hero`, `Skills`, `ProjectsGrid`, `About`, `ContactForm`, `Footer`).
- Lay them out in the correct order inside a main container.
- The root element should have a dark background color from the 'Aurora Dark' theme (`#0F172A`).

Execute these steps to provide a complete, ready-to-develop project foundation.
```

### Step 2: Header & Footer

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Goal**: Build the reusable frame for the site—navigation at the top and info at the bottom.

#### Tasks:

1. **Header Component**:

   - Sticky header that stays at the top on scroll
   - Left: "Alex Doe" as logo
   - Right: Navigation menu ("About", "Projects", "Contact")
   - Modern hover effects with underline animation

2. **Footer Component**:
   - Copyright notice
   - Social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn)

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
Based on our existing project structure, build the `Header` and `Footer` components.

**1. Header (`features/header/Header.tsx`):**
- Create a sticky header that stays at the top of the page on scroll.
- On the left, display the name "Alex Doe" as a logo.
- On the right, create a navigation menu with links for "About", "Projects", and "Contact".
- Apply the modern hover effect to the links: text turns Aurora purple (`#A855F7`) and an underline animates in from the center using Aurora blue (`#3B82F6`).
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

**2. Footer (`features/footer/Footer.tsx`):**
- Create a simple footer.
- On the left, show a copyright notice: `© 2025 Alex Doe. All rights reserved.`
- On the right, display icons for GitHub and LinkedIn. Import the URLs from our `data.ts` file.
```

### Step 3: Hero Section (with UI Animations)

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Goal**: Create the stunning, above-the-fold content that visitors see first.

#### Tasks:

1. **Content**: Main heading, subtitle, and action buttons
2. **Animation**: Framer Motion fade-in and slide-up with stagger effect
3. **Background**: Subtle animated grid pattern

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
Now, build the `Hero.tsx` component.

1. **Content:**
   - Fetch the name and title from `src/lib/data.ts`.
   - Display a main heading: "Building Scalable Solutions with Modern Technology".
   - Display the title underneath: "I'm a **Full-Stack Developer & Tech Enthusiast**". Make the title stand out with Aurora purple accent color (`#A855F7`).
   - Add two buttons: a primary "View My Projects" and a secondary "Download Resume".

2. **Animation:**
   - Use `framer-motion` to animate the elements on page load.
   - The heading, title, and buttons should fade in and slide up slightly.
   - Apply a stagger effect so they animate in one by one.

3. **Background:**
   - Implement the subtle, animated grid background directly on the hero section's container. The grid lines should be a very low-opacity grey.
```

### Step 4: Skills & Projects Sections

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Goal**: Showcase technical abilities and portfolio work.

#### Tasks:

1. **Skills Component**: Tech stack display with pill/badge design
2. **Projects Grid**: Project cards with hover effects
3. **Project Card**: Individual project display component

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
Build the `Skills` and `ProjectsGrid` sections.

**1. Skills Component (`features/skills/Skills.tsx`):**
- Create a section with the title "My Tech Stack".
- Import the `skills` array from `src/lib/data.ts`.
- Map over the array to display each skill as a styled "pill" or "badge".
- Arrange the pills in a responsive grid that looks good on all screen sizes.
- Add a subtle hover effect to the pills: slight scale-up with Aurora purple glow (`#A855F7` with low opacity).

**2. Projects Components (`features/projects/`):**
- In `ProjectsGrid.tsx`, create a section with the title "My Projects".
- Import the `projects` array from `data.ts`. Map over it to render a `ProjectCard.tsx` component for each project, passing the project data as props.
- In `ProjectCard.tsx`, display the project's title, description, and a list of its tech stack. Style it as a modern, clean card with Aurora blue border (`#3B82F6`) and a subtle Aurora purple shadow on hover.
```

### Step 5: About & Contact Sections

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Goal**: Add personal bio and contact functionality.

#### Tasks:

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
Build the `About` and `ContactForm` components.

**1. About (`features/about/About.tsx`):**
- Create a section with the title "About Me".
- Use a two-column layout. On the left, display a placeholder for a professional profile photo. On the right, display the `bio` imported from `src/lib/data.ts`.

**2. Contact Form (`features/contact/ContactForm.tsx`):**
- Create a section with the title "Get in Touch".
- Build a simple and clean form with fields for "Name", "Email", and "Message".
- Configure the form to submit to **Formspree**. Use the dummy email `contact@alexdoe.dev` for the action URL.
```

### Step 6: Add the 3D "Wow" Factor

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### Step 7: Final Polish

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Goal**: Add professional finishing touches and optimize user experience.

#### Tasks Completed:

1. **Enhanced Scrolling**:

   - Custom Aurora-themed scrollbar
   - Smooth scroll behavior
   - Scroll-to-top button with animations

2. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - Lazy loading components
   - Intersection observer for scroll animations
   - CSS-only 3D effects (replaced Three.js for better compatibility)

3. **User Experience Enhancements**:

   - Loading spinners with Aurora theme
   - Improved focus states for accessibility
   - Smooth transitions on all interactive elements

4. **SEO & Accessibility**:

   - Dynamic meta tags
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - High contrast Aurora color scheme

5. **Visual Polish**:
   - Custom selection colors
   - Shimmer loading animations
   - Enhanced hover effects
   - Parallax scroll effects

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
Let's add the 3D element.

1. **Create the Scene (`features/hero/Scene3D.tsx`):**
   - Inside this component, use `@react-three/fiber` to set up a `<Canvas>`.
   - Add ambient and point lighting to the scene.
   - Using `@react-three/drei`, render a `<TorusKnot>` mesh that slowly rotates. Give it a `MeshDistortMaterial` to create a cool, morphing effect.
   - Make the scene interactive using `<OrbitControls>`.

2. **Integrate into Hero:**
   - Import the `Scene3D` component into `Hero.tsx` and place it in the background or alongside the main text. Ensure it doesn't block the text.
```

### Step 8: Final Polish & Deployment

**Status**: ⏳ Pending (Polish ✅ Completed, Deployment Skipped per User Request)
**Goal**: Add scroll animations and deploy the site.

#### Tasks:

1. **Scroll Animations**: Implement scroll-triggered animations for all sections
2. **Deployment**: Build and deploy to Vercel

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
The website is visually complete. Let's add the final polish and prepare for deployment.

**1. Scroll Animations:**
- Go through `App.tsx` and wrap each main section component (`Skills`, `ProjectsGrid`, `About`, `ContactForm`) in a `motion` tag from `framer-motion`.
- Use the `whileInView` prop to make each section fade in and slide up as it scrolls into the viewport. Set it to trigger only once.

**2. Deployment Guide:**
- Provide me with the terminal command to create a production build of my Vite project.
- Then, give me a simple, step-by-step guide on how to deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to **Vercel** for free.
```
