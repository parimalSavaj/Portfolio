## üéØ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: 3D Interactive Globe (1 hour)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Goal**: Replace atom animation with interactive 3D globe

#### Tasks:

1. **Globe Geometry**:

   - Create sphere with world map texture
   - Add atmosphere glow layer
   - Implement auto-rotation

2. **Interactivity**:

   - Add OrbitControls for user interaction
   - Smooth mouse-drag rotation
   - Maintain auto-rotation when idle

3. **Lighting & Materials**:
   - Ambient and point lighting setup
   - Realistic globe material properties
   - Aurora-themed atmosphere effect

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
You are a React Three Fiber expert. Please replace the content of my Scene3D.tsx component with a new 3D animation.

Remove the current "atom" animation and its related code.

Using React Three Fiber and the Drei library, create a new scene featuring an interactive 3D globe.

Create a sphere and apply a world map texture to its surface. You can use a free, high-quality texture from a site like solarsystemscope.com/textures/.

Add a second, slightly larger, semi-transparent sphere around the globe to represent an "atmosphere" or glow.

Make the globe slowly auto-rotate on its own axis.

Use Drei's <OrbitControls> to allow the user to click and drag to spin the globe interactively.

Add appropriate lighting (ambientLight and pointLight) to make the globe look good.
```

### Step 2: Custom Focus Styling (20 mins)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Goal**: Replace default focus outline with Aurora-themed glow

#### Tasks:

1. **Global Focus Styles**:

   - Add `:focus-visible` rules to globals.css
   - Remove default outline
   - Add Aurora purple glow effect

2. **Accessibility Maintenance**:
   - Ensure keyboard navigation remains clear
   - Test with tab navigation
   - Maintain contrast requirements

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
In my global CSS file (src/styles/globals.css), I want to customize the default browser focus outline for all interactive elements like links (<a>) and buttons (<button>).

Find the base styles for the entire application.

Add a new rule that targets any element in a :focus-visible state. This is better than :focus because it only applies to keyboard navigation, not mouse clicks.

Inside the rule, first set outline: none; to remove the default box.

Then, as an accessible replacement, add a box-shadow to create a subtle glow. Use a color that matches my site's theme. For example: box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.6);
```

---

### Step 3: Hover Effect Corner Fix (15 mins)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Goal**: Fix corner shape mismatch in card hover effects

#### Tasks:

1. **Identify Hover Elements**:

   - Find glow-creating elements in Skills and Projects
   - Check for pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)
   - Locate shadow/border effects

2. **Apply Consistent Border Radius**:
   - Match card's `rounded-xl` (0.75rem)
   - Update all hover effect elements
   - Test on both card types

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
I need to fix the shape of the hover effect on my Tech Stack and Project cards.

The glowing border that appears on hover has sharp, rectangular corners, but the cards themselves have rounded corners. Please inspect the CSS for the hover state on these cards.

Find the element or pseudo-element (::before or ::after) that creates the glow and apply the exact same border-radius value that the main card component uses. This will make the glowing outline perfectly follow the card's rounded shape.
```

---

### Step 4: Custom Form Validation (45 mins)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Goal**: Replace browser popups with custom Aurora-themed validation

#### Tasks:

1. **Disable Default Validation**:

   - Add `noValidate` to form element
   - Implement React state for errors
   - Create validation logic

2. **Custom Error Display**:

   - Style error messages with Aurora theme
   - Add smooth error state transitions
   - Position messages properly

3. **Enhanced UX**:
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Clear error states on correction
   - Accessible error announcements

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
I want to create custom validation error messages for my ContactForm.tsx component.

In the <form> element, add the noValidate attribute. This will disable the default browser validation popups.

Use React's useState hook to create an errors state object. It should hold error messages for the name, email, and message fields.

Modify the handleSubmit function. Before submitting, check if each field is empty. If a field is empty, update the errors state with a message like "This field is required." for that field and prevent the form submission.

In the JSX, directly below each <input> and <textarea>, conditionally render the error message from the state. If errors.name exists, display it, and so on.

Style the error message text to be noticeable, for example, using a bright pink or light red color and a small font size.
```

### Step 5: Section Height Optimization (20 mins)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Goal**: Optimize Hero and About section heights for better screen fit

#### Tasks:

1. **Hero Section**:

   - Ensure proper viewport height usage
   - Add flex centering for content
   - Optimize for all screen sizes

2. **About Section**:
   - Reduce excessive vertical padding
   - Optimize content spacing
   - Maintain visual hierarchy

#### Cursor Prompt:

```
I need to adjust the height of my Hero and About sections to make them more compact and fit the screen better.

For the Hero Section:

Find the main container div for the Hero.tsx component.

Ensure it is using the Tailwind CSS class min-h-screen. This makes it fill the screen's height.

Add the classes flex flex-col justify-center to the same container. This will vertically center all the content within the hero section, ensuring it looks balanced and fits well.

For the About Section:

Find the main container div for the About.tsx component.

The section is likely too long due to excessive padding.

Locate the vertical padding class (e.g., py-24 or py-32) and reduce the value significantly (e.g., try py-16 or py-20).

Also, check for any large vertical margins (my-) and reduce those as well. This will make the section take up less vertical space.
```
